## wordMaster
Final project of Brian Holt's "Complete Intro to Web Develpment, v3". 
This is a wordle game. Core purpose is to learn how to call APIs with JS.
Still a bit work is left, but the main functionality of guessing the correct 
word and checking if it is a valid guess or not works just fine.
