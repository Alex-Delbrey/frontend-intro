# frontend-intro

Finally getting around to learning some frontend lol. 
Started taking some courses from [frontendMasters](frontendmasters.com)

## checkoutPage
This is a simple checkout page for coffee masters page.

## combiningEverything
This is a simple calculator app. Made with js, html, and css.
I just made it work, I'll cleanup the code later :)
